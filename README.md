# Moodmap Application - README

## Overview

**Moodmap** is an application designed to help users track and visualize their daily mood. By selecting a mood on a daily basis, users can map their emotional state throughout the month and gain insights into their overall well-being. The app displays a calendar with the current day selected by default and provides 5 mood options, each represented by a color shade.

## Features

- **Mood Tracking:** Users can select one of five moods every day, ranging from "very sad" to "elated."

- **Calendar View:** A calendar is displayed, highlighting the current day by default. Each day is shaded based on the mood selected, with colors representing different mood intensities.

- **Responsive UI:** The application is responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Mood Options

Each mood is represented by a button. The options include:

1. **Very Sad** (value: 1)
2. **Sad** (value: 2)
3. **Existing** (value: 3)
4. **Good** (value: 4)
5. **Elated** (value: 5)

## Mood Colors

Each mood is associated with a unique color shade that visually reflects the emotional intensity:

- **Very Sad:** Bright shade of pink

- **Sad:** Light shade of pink

- **Existing:** Neutral color pink

- **Good:** Light shade of pink

- **Elated:** Dark shade of pink

These colors allow users to easily see how their moods change over time when viewing the calendar.
